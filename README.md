Have you ever pondered the manner in which lenders employ a variety of factors, such as credit scores, annual income, approved loan amounts, tenure, debt-to-income ratios, and more, in order to determine your interest rates? This process, referred to as 'risk-based pricing,' involves a sophisticated algorithm that utilizes diverse determinants from loan applicants. By selecting key factors, a predictive algorithm can be developed to estimate loan interest rates based on clients' information. On one hand, comprehending these factors aids consumers and borrowers in enhancing their creditworthiness, thereby positioning themselves more favorably to negotiate for lower interest rates. On the other hand, lending institutions can swiftly obtain a fixed interest rate estimate based on client information. In this context, your objective is to utilize a training dataset to predict the loan rate category (1 / 2 / 3) that will be assigned to each loan in our test set. You can engage in feature engineering by employing various combinations of dataset features to enhance the accuracy of your loan rate category predictions. Certain features may prove more straightforward to utilize than others.
